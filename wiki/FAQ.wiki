= Introduction =

This is brand new and nobody has asked me any questions but if you have some, http://polarcloud.com/rikaichan-faq might have some answers.

The stuff about installing won't work of course, but if you visit the google gallery link on the main page, it will tell you about installing chrome extensions.

File an issue if you want as well.  Or send me a message somehow.

I'm going to go ahead and make up a question or two as well.


= Details =

 # How do I turn it on?
  * Click the icon next to the omnibar.  A help menu should pop up and an on sticker should appear on the rikaikun icon.
 # I turned it on, how come nothing is happening?
  * There could be a couple of reasons.
    # There's no Japanese on the page. rikaikun translates Japanese.
    # If a page was open, before you installed rikaikun, you must refresh the page.  This is because before the extension was installed it couldn't be injected. (Obviously.)
